This is a python program to generate random image datasets for image classification training.

The program generates image datasets for seperating circles, pentagons, rectangles, triangles in seperate folders.

The generated datasets contain some form of distortion to simulate the error on test datasets.

This was used as dataset for image classification using tensorflow.
